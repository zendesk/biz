* Schedule intersection.
* Thread safety.

## Anti-Features

* No dependency on ActiveSupport.
* No monkey patching by default.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'biz'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install biz

## Configuration

```ruby
Biz.configure do |config|
  config.hours = {
    mon: {'09:00' => '17:00'},
    tue: {'00:00' => '24:00'},
    wed: {'09:00' => '17:00'},
    thu: {'09:00' => '12:00', '13:00' => '17:00'},
    sat: {'10:00' => '14:00'}
  }

  config.breaks = {
    Date.new(2006, 1, 2) => {'10:00' => '11:30'},
    Date.new(2006, 1, 3) => {'14:15' => '14:30', '15:40' => '15:50'}
  }

  config.holidays = [Date.new(2016, 1, 1), Date.new(2016, 12, 25)]

  config.time_zone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
end
```

Periods occurring on holidays are disregarded. Similarly, any segment of a
period that overlaps with a break is treated as inactive.

If global configuration isn't your thing, configure an instance instead:

```ruby
schedule = Biz::Schedule.new do |config|
  # ...
end

# then use your schedule just like Biz
schedule.time(30, :minutes).before(Time.utc(2015, 1, 1, 11, 45))
```

Note that times must be specified in 24-hour clock format and time zones
must be [IANA identifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

## Usage

```ruby
# Find the time an amount of business time *before* a specified starting time
Biz.time(30, :minutes).before(Time.utc(2015, 1, 1, 11, 45))

# Find the time an amount of business time *after* a specified starting time
Biz.time(2, :hours).after(Time.utc(2015, 12, 25, 9, 30))

# Calculations can be performed in seconds, minutes, hours, or days
Biz.time(1, :day).after(Time.utc(2015, 1, 8, 10))

# Find the amount of business time between two times
Biz.within(Time.utc(2015, 3, 7), Time.utc(2015, 3, 14)).in_seconds

# Determine if a time is in business hours
Biz.in_hours?(Time.utc(2015, 1, 10, 9))

# Determine if a time is during a break
Biz.on_break?(Time.utc(2016, 6, 3))

# Determine if a time is during a holiday
Biz.on_holiday?(Time.utc(2014, 1, 1))
```

All returned times are in UTC.

If a schedule will be configured with a large number of holidays and performance
is a particular concern, it's recommended that holidays are filtered down to
those relevant to the calculation(s) at hand before configuration to improve
performance.

By dropping down a level, you can get access to the underlying time segments,
which you can use to do your own custom calculations or just get a better idea
of what's happening under the hood:

```ruby
Biz.periods.after(Time.utc(2015, 1, 10, 10)).timeline
  .until(Time.utc(2015, 1, 17, 10)).to_a

#=> [#<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-10 18:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-10 22:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-12 17:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-13 01:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-13 08:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-14 08:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-14 17:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-15 01:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-15 17:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-15 20:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-01-15 21:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-01-16 01:00:00 UTC>]

Biz.periods
  .before(Time.utc(2015, 5, 5, 12, 34, 57)).timeline
  .for(Biz::Duration.minutes(3_598)).to_a

#=> [#<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-05-05 07:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-05-05 12:34:57 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-05-04 16:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-05-05 00:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-05-02 17:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-05-02 21:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-04-30 20:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-05-01 00:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-04-30 16:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-04-30 19:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-04-29 16:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-04-30 00:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-04-28 07:00:00 UTC end_time=2015-04-29 07:00:00 UTC>,
#  #<Biz::TimeSegment start_time=2015-04-27 20:36:57 UTC end_time=2015-04-28 00:00:00 UTC>]
```

#### Day calculation semantics

Unlike seconds, minutes, or hours, a "day" is an ambiguous concept, particularly
in relation to the vast number of potential schedule configurations. Because of
that, day calculations are implemented with the principle of making the logic as
straightforward as possible while knowing not all use cases will be satisfied
out of the box.

Here's the logic that's followed:

> Find the next day that contains business hours. Starting from the same minute
> on that day as the specified time, look forward (or back) to find the next
> moment in time that is in business hours.

## Schedule intersection

An intersection of two schedules can be found using `&`:

```ruby
schedule_1 = Biz::Schedule.new do |config|
  config.hours = {
    mon: {'09:00' => '17:00'},
    tue: {'10:00' => '16:00'},
    wed: {'09:00' => '17:00'},
    thu: {'10:00' => '16:00'},
    fri: {'09:00' => '17:00'},
    sat: {'11:00' => '14:30'}
  }

  config.breaks = {
    Date.new(2016, 6, 2) => {'09:00' => '10:30', '16:00' => '16:30'},
    Date.new(2016, 6, 3) => {'12:15' => '12:45'}
  }

  config.holidays = [Date.new(2016, 1, 1), Date.new(2016, 12, 25)]

  config.time_zone = 'Etc/UTC'
end

schedule_2 = Biz::Schedule.new do |config|
  config.hours = {
    sun: {'10:00' => '12:00'},
    mon: {'08:00' => '10:00'},
    tue: {'11:00' => '15:00'},
    wed: {'16:00' => '18:00'},
    thu: {'11:00' => '12:00', '13:00' => '14:00'}
  }

  config.breaks = {
    Date.new(2016, 6, 3) => {'13:30' => '14:00'},
    Date.new(2016, 6, 4) => {'11:00' => '12:00'}
  }

  config.holidays = [
    Date.new(2016, 1, 1),
    Date.new(2016, 7, 4),
    Date.new(2016, 11, 24)
  ]

  config.time_zone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
end

schedule_1 & schedule_2
```

The resulting schedule will be a combination of the two schedules: an
intersection of the intervals, a union of the breaks and holidays, and the time
zone of the first schedule.

For the above example, the resulting schedule would be equivalent to one with
the following configuration:

```ruby
Biz::Schedule.new do |config|
  config.hours = {
    mon: {'09:00' => '10:00'},
    tue: {'11:00' => '15:00'},
    wed: {'16:00' => '17:00'},
    thu: {'11:00' => '12:00', '13:00' => '14:00'}
  }

  config.breaks = {
    Date.new(2016, 6, 2) => {'09:00' => '10:30', '16:00' => '16:30'},
    Date.new(2016, 6, 3) => {'12:15' => '12:45', '13:30' => '14:00'},
    Date.new(2016, 6, 4) => {'11:00' => '12:00'}
  }

  config.holidays = [
    Date.new(2016, 1, 1),
    Date.new(2016, 7, 4),
    Date.new(2016, 11, 24),
    Date.new(2016, 12, 25)
  ]

  config.time_zone = 'Etc/UTC'
end
```

## Core extensions

Optional extensions to core classes (`Date`, `Integer`, and `Time`) are
available for additional expressiveness:

```ruby
require 'biz/core_ext'

75.business_seconds.after(Time.utc(2015, 3, 5, 12, 30))

30.business_minutes.before(Time.utc(2015, 1, 1, 11, 45))

5.business_hours.after(Time.utc(2015, 4, 7, 8, 20))

3.business_days.before(Time.utc(2015, 5, 9, 4, 12))

Time.utc(2015, 8, 20, 9, 30).business_hours?

Time.utc(2016, 6, 3, 12).on_break?

Time.utc(2014, 1, 1, 12).on_holiday?

Date.new(2015, 12, 10).business_day?
```
